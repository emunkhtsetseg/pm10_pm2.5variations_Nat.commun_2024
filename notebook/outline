## Research Qs
1. Do concentrations of particulate matters differ in between urban and rural sites, and even within Gobi sites?
2. Do distinct temporal variations has existed among the sites?
3. Do PM2.5 particulates has contributed to the PM10 annual variations?
  - If yes, how much, and when and where?
  - What is the sd, mean, and median
    - box plot
    - violin
    - scatter points, epidemic, sporadic
  - Daily variations to examine it related to the heating
    - 2 peaks: smaller and bigger
    - compare the t-duration exceeds 50mug/m3/hour
4. Does it has distinct patterns among the sites regarding to the drivings
  - How PMs varies with the wind speed and visibility
  - Do they differently explained with variables and changes in drivings (with PCA analysis)
5. Is there any significant changes in time-series of PMs at 4 seasons
6. Is there any significant changes in ratio in the spring in respect to winter?


## Results
* The spatio-temporal variations of the PMs at the study sites
  - Concentrations of particulate matters differ in between urban and rural sites, and even within Gobi sites.
  - Distinct temporal variations has existed among the sites.
  - PM2.5 particulates has contributed to the PM10 annual variations in UB and in DZ in winter.
    - If yes, how much, and when and where?
    - What is the sd, mean, and median
      - box plot
      - violin
      - scatter points, epidemic, sporadic
    - Daily variations to examine it related to the heating
      - 2 peaks: smaller and bigger
      - compare the t-duration exceeds 50mug/m3/hour

* The emission patterns of interrelations among meteorological variables at the study sites
  - PMs varies with the wind speed and visibility
  - In general, three distinct patterns were resulted with PCA analysis, which is in consistent with temporal variation. explained with variables and changes in drivings (with PCA analysis)

* The recent trends in concentrations of PMS and fine-coarse fractional changes at the sites
  - There are significant changes in time-series of PMs at 4 seasons
  - There any significant changes in ratio in the spring in respect to winter in DZ.
  - Close relationships was found between PM2.5 in winter and r values in the spring.


## Conclusions
* The spatio-temporal variations of the PMs at the study sites
  - Concentrations of particulate matters differ in between urban and rural sites, and even within Gobi sites.
  - Distinct temporal variations has existed among the sites.
  - PM2.5 particulates has contributed to the PM10 annual variations in UB and in DZ in winter.
    - If yes, how much, and when and where?

    - Daily variations to examine it related to the heating
      - 2 peaks: smaller and bigger

* The emission patterns of interrelations among meteorological variables at the study sites
  - PMs varies with the wind speed and visibility
  - In general, three distinct patterns were resulted with PCA analysis, which is in consistent with temporal variation. explained with variables and changes in drivings (with PCA analysis)

* The recent trends in concentrations of PMS and fine-coarse fractional changes at the sites
  - There are significant changes in time-series of PMs at 4 seasons
  - There any significant changes in ratio in the spring in respect to winter PM2.5 in DZ.
- Close relationships was found between PM2.5 in winter and r values in the spring.
Thus, our research results clearly proves the distinct variations in PMs has emerged.
The dust fine-coarse fractions was manifested at the town center for the Gobi sites, which
reveals the that Mongolian dust composites not only coarse dust, but also fine particulate matters. The particulates likely consisted of the black carbon,
which may give a substantial effect on climate systems. if this trend continues on as coal consumption with the population growth in the future.
- CO Carbon monoxide is obtained due to incomplete combustion of charcoal in a closed room.
- CO2
